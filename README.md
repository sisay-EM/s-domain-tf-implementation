 Continuous-Time Transfer Function Implementations

This repository demonstrates **three distinct methods** for implementing continuous-time transfer functions (in the s-domain) using code. It serves as a practical bridge between control theory and embedded or simulation-based applications.

 üîç What‚Äôs Inside
 Method 1: Numerically solve the differential equation
 Method 2: Convert the transfer function to a state space model
 Method 3: Convert the transfer function to the z-domain

Each method is documented with code examples to help you understand the trade-offs and use cases.
